Potential Implmentation Notes***

- for an example of using serialization and deserialization we can take the average bi-weekly bill
amount the user enters in and serialize the state of that object and create another applicaqtion
either a console or web app and have it perform like an apprasail for credit approval os some other
system and then send the data back to the user in our web app

(1-10-19 11:42am) - we are brainstorming and studying serialization and deserialization. We have a potential new feature
for our financial budget app, where our app will hold a users bi-weekly budget and salary info and send it to an external
system (third party app) that will determine some info. We are looking to serialize the object data from our app and then 
the other app we create will deserialize that info and send it back (maybe via API). (!!!*** REFER TO NOTES IN IPAD ***!!!)
